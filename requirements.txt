# JUPYTER NOTEBOOK STRUGGLES:
# -with Anaconda3 2024-02-1-Windows-x86_64.exe the
#  installed version of ipykernel is 6.28.0. We need
#  this module to create a kernel specific to the
#  virtualenv we will use in this repo since Jupyter
#  notebooks are so convenient. Once this module is
#  installed we can take advantage of the ol'
#  python -m ipykernel install --user --name=xyz
#  in our trusty always_run_me_first batch file (but
#  we only technically need to do that once).
ipykernel==6.28.0
# MATPLOTLIB and MPLFINANCE:
# -Anaconda3 2024-02-1-Windows-x86_64.exe comes with
#  matplotlib version 3.8.0, so we stick with that
#  coupled with mplfinance for candlestick-specific
#  graphing purposes.
